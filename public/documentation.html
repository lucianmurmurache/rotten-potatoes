              (including explosions, fight scenes, daring escapes, etc.). Action and adventure are usually categorized together
              (sometimes even as "action-adventure") because they have much in common, and many stories fall under both genres simultaneously

              genre elements included within it, because it is a very open genre. The protagonist has a mission and faces obstacles to get to
              their destination. Also, adventure stories usually include unknown settings and characters with prized properties or features.

          <td>Drama</td>
          <td>Within film, television and radio (but not theatre), drama is a genre of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more
              serious than humorous in tone,[2] focusing on in-depth development of realistic characters who must deal with realistic emotional
              struggles. A drama is commonly considered the opposite of a comedy, but may also be considered separate from other works of some
              broad genre, such as a fantasy.

          <td>A fantasy story is about magic or supernatural forces, rather than technology (as science fiction) if it happens to take place in
              a modern or future era. Depending on the extent of these other elements, the story may or may not be considered to be a "hybrid
              genre" series; for instance, even though the Harry Potter series canon includes the requirement of a particular gene to be a
              wizard, it is referred to only as a fantasy series.

          <td>Although animation is listed under "Genres" and is classified as a genre by many film critics and streaming services, there is
              an ongoing debate between the animation community and the general public whether animation is a genre or a medium; and that the
              genres in the "Live-action scripted" genre can also be portrayed in an animated format, and the below kinds of animation are not
              types of stories, but simply types of ways that a film can be animated.

          <td>8</td>
          <td>Mystery</td>
          <td>A mystery story follows an investigator as they attempt to solve a puzzle (often a crime). The details and clues are presented
              as the story continues and the protagonist discovers them and by the end of the story the mystery/puzzle is solved. For example,
              in the case of a crime mystery the perpetrator and motive behind the crime are revealed and the perpetrator is brought to justice.
              Mystery novels are often written in series, which facilitates a more in-depth development of the primary investigator.
              Specific types of mystery story include locked room mysteries and cozy mysteries.

          <td>Science fiction is similar to fantasy, except stories in this genre use scientific understanding to explain the universe that it takes
              place in. It generally includes or is centered on the presumed effects or ramifications of computers or machines; travel through space,
              time or alternate universes; alien life-forms; genetic engineering; or other such things. The science or technology used may or may not
              be very thoroughly elaborated on; stories whose scientific elements are reasonably detailed, well-researched and considered to be
              relatively plausible given current knowledge and technology are often referred to as hard science fiction.

              adventure or mystery genres, but the level of terror makes it borderline horror fiction at times as well. It generally has a dark or
              serious theme, which also makes it similar to drama.
