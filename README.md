# rotten-potatoes

## Project Description: 
#### RottenPotatoes provides users with access to information related to different movies, directors, movie genres and actors. Users will be able to register, update their information and create a list of their favourite movies.

## Features:
#### 1. Return a list of all available movies to the user.
#### 2. Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it’s featured or not) about a single movie by title to the user.
#### 3. Return data about a genre by name.
#### 4. Return data about a director (including bio, birth year) by name.
#### 5. Allow new users to register.
#### 6. Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth).
#### 7. Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites.
#### 8. Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites.
#### 9. Allow existing users to deregister.

## Requirements:
#### The API must be a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) application.
#### The API must use REST architecture, with URL endpoints corresponding to the data operations listed in Features(see above section).
#### The API must use at least three middleware modules, such as the [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) package for reading data from requests and [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) for logging.
#### The API must use a “package.json” file.
#### The database must be built using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
#### The business logic must be modeled with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/).
#### The API must provide movie information in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format.
